# Django-Ecommerce-API
This is a Ecommerce API website that I created whilst testing out the various different possibilities and features of Django

This mainly covers the back-end and hence is focused heavily on that!
To see the available links and options, one could refer to the codebase itself or use Django Debug to be able to see the available urls
The codebase contains alot of commented out code, which is for my own reference of doing a single thing, many different ways in Django
